Flashcards is a fully functional application with a working backend allowing for continual use and storage.

This application allows for users to create, edit, and delete a deck of flashcards as well as individual cards. 
A deck is created with a name and description, to identify its' purpose, whereas a card has a front and back, representing a question and answer. 
Once a deck has stored atleast 3 flashcards, it can be studied. Until then the page will state that fact and prompt users to create more cards.
Each card has a front and back which can be toggled between on the given deck's study page, giving the ability to review a question before looking at the answer.
After the last flashcard is reviewed a prompt is provided asking if the user would like to restart the deck. On confirmation the deck restarts to the first card otherwise the user is sent back to the home screen.
Aside from the home screen, every page has a functional navigation bar that includes a link to previous pages including the home screen while displaying the current page.
